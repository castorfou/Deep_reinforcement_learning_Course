# ## Important note ü§î
# <b> You can run it on your computer but it's better to run it on GPU based services</b>, personally I use Microsoft Azure and their Deep Learning Virtual Machine (they offer 170$)
# https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.dsvm-deep-learning
# <br>
# ‚ö†Ô∏è I don't have any business relations with them. I just loved their excellent customer service.
# 
# If you have some troubles to use Microsoft Azure follow the explainations of this excellent article here (without last the part fast.ai): https://medium.com/@manikantayadunanda/setting-up-deeplearning-machine-and-fast-ai-on-azure-a22eb6bd6429

# ## Prerequisites üèóÔ∏è
# Before diving on the notebook **you need to understand**:
# - The foundations of Reinforcement learning (MC, TD, Rewards hypothesis...) [Article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419)
# - Policy gradients [Article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-introduction-to-policy-gradients-with-cartpole-and-doom-495b5ef2207f)
# - We made a [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/wLTQRuizVyE) where we implement a Policy Gradient agent with Tensorflow that learns to play Doom üëπüî´ in a Deathmatch environment.

# ## Step 1: Import the libraries üìö

# In[2]:


import tensorflow as tf      # Deep Learning library
import numpy as np           # Handle matrices
from vizdoom import *        # Doom Environment
import random                # Handling random number generation
import time                  # Handling time calculation
from skimage import transform# Help us to preprocess the frames

from collections import deque# Ordered collection with ends
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Display graphs

import warnings # This ignore all the warning messages that are normally printed during the training because of skiimage
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')


# In[3]:


config = tf.ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth=True


# ## Step 2: Create our environment üéÆ
# - Now that we imported the libraries/dependencies, we will create our environment.
# - Doom environment takes:
#     - A `configuration file` that **handle all the options** (size of the frame, possible actions...)
#     - A `scenario file`: that **generates the correct scenario** (in our case basic **but you're invited to try other scenarios**).
# - Note: We have 3 possible actions `[[0,0,1], [1,0,0], [0,1,0]]` so we don't need to do one hot encoding (thanks to < a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2237916/silgon">silgon</a> for figuring out. 
# 
# ### Our environment
# <img src="assets/health_doom.jpg" style="max-width:500px;" alt="Doom health"/>
# 
# The purpose of this scenario is to teach the agent **how to survive without knowing what makes him survive.** Agent know only that life is precious and death is bad so he must learn what prolongs his existence and that his health is connected with it.
# 
# Map is a rectangle with green, acidic floor which hurts the player periodically. Initially there are some medkits spread uniformly over the map. A new medkit falls from the skies every now and then. **Medkits heal some portions of player's health - to survive agent needs to pick them up. Episode finishes after player's death or on timeout.**
# 
# Further configuration:
# 
# - living_reward = 1
# - 3 available buttons: turn left, turn right, move forward
# - 1 available game variable: HEALTH
# - death penalty = 100
# <br><br>

# In[4]:


"""
Here we create our environment
"""
def create_environment():
    game = DoomGame()
    
    # Load the correct configuration
    game.load_config("health_gathering.cfg")
    
    # Load the correct scenario (in our case defend_the_center scenario)
    game.set_doom_scenario_path("health_gathering.wad")
    
    game.init()
    
    # Here our possible actions
    # [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
    possible_actions  = np.identity(3,dtype=int).tolist()
    
    return game, possible_actions


# In[5]:


game, possible_actions = create_environment()


# ## Step 3: Define the preprocessing functions ‚öôÔ∏è
# ### preprocess_frame üñºÔ∏è
# Preprocessing is an important step, <b>because we want to reduce the complexity of our states to reduce the computation time needed for training.</b>
# <br><br>
# Our steps:
# - Grayscale each of our frames (because <b> color does not add important information </b>). But this is already done by the config file.
# - Crop the screen (in our case we remove the roof because it contains no information)
# - We normalize pixel values
# - Finally we resize the preprocessed frame

# In[6]:


"""
    preprocess_frame:
    Take a frame.
    Resize it.

    """
def preprocess_frame(frame):
    # Greyscale frame already done in our vizdoom config
    # x = np.mean(frame,-1)
    
    # Crop the screen (remove the roof because it contains no information)
    # [Up: Down, Left: right]
    cropped_frame = frame[80:,:]
    
    # Normalize Pixel Values

    # Resize
    preprocessed_frame = transform.resize(normalized_frame, [84,84])
    
    return preprocessed_frame


# ### stack_frames
# üëè This part was made possible thanks to help of <a href="https://github.com/Miffyli">Anssi</a><br>
# 
# As explained in this really <a href="https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2016/11/25/frame-skipping-and-preprocessing-for-deep-q-networks-on-atari-2600-games/">  good article </a> we stack frames.
# 
# Stacking frames is really important because it helps us to **give have a sense of motion to our Neural Network.**
# 
# - First we preprocess frame
# - Then we append the frame to the deque that automatically **removes the oldest frame**
# - Finally we **build the stacked state**
# 
# This is how work stack:
# - For the first frame, we feed 4 frames
# - At each timestep, **we add the new frame to deque and then we stack them to form a new stacked frame**
# - And so on
# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course/master/DQN/Space%20Invaders/assets/stack_frames.png" alt="stack">
# - If we're done, **we create a new stack with 4 new frames (because we are in a new episode)**.

# In[7]:


stack_size = 4 # We stack 4 frames

# Initialize deque with zero-images one array for each image
stacked_frames  =  deque([np.zeros((84,84), dtype=np.int) for i in range(stack_size)], maxlen=4) 

def stack_frames(stacked_frames, state, is_new_episode):
    # Preprocess frame
    frame = preprocess_frame(state)
    
    if is_new_episode:
        # Clear our stacked_frames
        stacked_frames = deque([np.zeros((84,84), dtype=np.int) for i in range(stack_size)], maxlen=4)
        
        # Because we're in a new episode, copy the same frame 4x
        stacked_frames.append(frame)
        stacked_frames.append(frame)
        stacked_frames.append(frame)
        stacked_frames.append(frame)
        
        # Stack the frames
        stacked_state = np.stack(stacked_frames, axis=2)

    else:
        # Append frame to deque, automatically removes the oldest frame
        stacked_frames.append(frame)

        # Build the stacked state (first dimension specifies different frames)
        stacked_state = np.stack(stacked_frames, axis=2) 
    
    return stacked_state, stacked_frames


# ### discount_and_normalize_rewards üí∞
# This function is important, because we are in a Monte Carlo situation. <br>
# 
# We need to **discount the rewards at the end of the episode**. This function takes, the reward discount it, and **then normalize them** (to avoid a big variability in rewards).

# In[8]:


def discount_and_normalize_rewards(episode_rewards):
    discounted_episode_rewards = np.zeros_like(episode_rewards)
    cumulative = 0.0
    for i in reversed(range(len(episode_rewards))):
        cumulative = cumulative * gamma + episode_rewards[i]
        discounted_episode_rewards[i] = cumulative
    
    mean = np.mean(discounted_episode_rewards)
    std = np.std(discounted_episode_rewards)
    discounted_episode_rewards = (discounted_episode_rewards - mean) / (std)

    return discounted_episode_rewards


# ## Step 4: Set up our hyperparameters ‚öóÔ∏è
# In this part we'll set up our different hyperparameters. But when you implement a Neural Network by yourself you will **not implement hyperparamaters at once but progressively**.
# 
# - First, you begin by defining the neural networks hyperparameters when you implement the model.
# - Then, you'll add the training hyperparameters when you implement the training algorithm.

# In[9]:


### ENVIRONMENT HYPERPARAMETERS
state_size = [84,84,4] # Our input is a stack of 4 frames hence 84x84x4 (Width, height, channels) 
action_size = game.get_available_buttons_size() # 3 possible actions: turn left, turn right, move forward
stack_size = 4 # Defines how many frames are stacked together

## TRAINING HYPERPARAMETERS
learning_rate = 0.002
num_epochs = 500 # Total epochs for training 

batch_size = 1000 # Each 1 is a timestep (NOT AN EPISODE) # YOU CAN CHANGE TO 5000 if you have GPU
gamma = 0.95 # Discounting rate

### MODIFY THIS TO FALSE IF YOU JUST WANT TO SEE THE TRAINED AGENT
training = True


# Quick note: Policy gradient methods like reinforce **are on-policy method which can not be updated from experience replay.**

# ## Step 5: Create our Policy Gradient Neural Network model üß†
